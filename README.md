# My portfolio website

I decided to have some fun and dip my toes into ``HTML`` and ``CSS`` following a guided project on [Coursera](coursera.org).

The site is work-in-progress, but following the course I was able to learn the foundamentals of HTML and CSS and build a skeleton for what my portfolio website might be in the future.
